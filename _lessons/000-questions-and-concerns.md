## Notes
There will be four courses offered this year. The first course, Ethiopian Thoughts in the Bible, will have seven sections and is open to the public on YouTube.
The course is designed to be accessible to everyone, allowing participants to start at different times and move at their own pace while catching up on previous lessons. Weekly lessons will be released on Friday evenings, Ethiopian local time, and participants are encouraged to join the Telegram channel while the webpage is being completed.
The course is currently offered in Amharic, with plans to offer it in English in the future to reach non-Amharic-speaking audiences. At the end of the course, participants may register to take an exam. Reading the articles and books listed on the reference page is encouraged. The course is free. A certificate of completion will be awarded to those who complete the course and pass the exam.
