## 📗 የፀሓይ ከተማ - City of the Sun 

**Author:** Dr. Meskerem Lechisa  
**Description:**  
An amharic historical study of Tommaso Campanella’s City of the Sun (1603), examining its previously unexplored connections to the Axumite civilization of Ethiopia. Dr. Meskerem Lechisa presents evidence-based arguments on the Axumite influence within this Renaissance-era utopian work, while also discussing Greco-Roman, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Indo-Iranian influences. The book concludes by reflecting on the relevance of these historical insights to contemporary political, religious, and social challenges in Ethiopia.
